            We kick-started operations on the 15th of August, 2010<br/>
             with the goal
            of breaking all barriers that traders and <br/>investors face in India in
            terms of cost, support, and <br/>technology. We named the company
            Zerodha, a <br/>combination of Zero and "Rodha", the Sanskrit word for<br/>
            barrier.
          </p>
          <p>Today, our disruptive pricing models and in-house<br/> technology have 
            made us the biggest stock broker in <br/>India.</p>
          <p>Over 1.6+ crore clients place billions of orders every year<br/> through
             our powerful ecosystem of investment<br/> platforms, contributing over 15% 
             of all Indian retail <br/>trading volumes.
